# Museum of Paleontology from Bucharest
This is a project for Web Techniques class. It is a web site that has been built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Node.js. It also uses a Mongo database in which different kinds of information about various types of dinosaurs are kept. The site makes different types of CRUD operations to show, create, delete etc the necessary data.

The theme is that of a site for a Paleontology Museum where there customers can buy tickets, the museum's exhibits are shown and where there is an encyclopedia type section. There is also a login/register area, which is very important for the Encyclopedia section, because only logged users can create, modify and delete the entries in the database about the dinosaurs. The user information are kept in a JSON file, the username and password being obtained through CRUD operations, like the ones applied on the Mongo database. All those kind of operations are placed on the server, that's the reason why Node.js has been used.

## There are also different requirements like:
- The implementation of a dark/light mode
- The use of session and local Storage
- The use of 5 different triggers
- The implementation of different animations
- The construction of the svg in HTML
- Creation and deletion of elements in a dynamic way using JavaScript
- The use of random, setTimeout and setInterval functions
